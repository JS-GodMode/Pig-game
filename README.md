# Pig Game üê∑üé≤

## Overview

Pig Game is a fun, interactive 2-player game built using pure JavaScript. The objective of the game is to reach 100 points before your opponent does. Players take turns rolling a dice, accumulating points during their turn. However, there's a catch! If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and all points collected during that turn are lost.

## How to Play

- The game consists of 2 players.
- On each turn, a player rolls a dice:
  - If they roll any number other than 1, that number is added to their current turn's score.
  - The player can then choose to either:
    - **Continue rolling** to accumulate more points.
    - **Hold** to add their current turn's score to their total score and pass the dice to the next player.
  - If the player rolls a 1, their current turn's score is reset, and it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins!

## Features

- **Simple Gameplay**: Roll the dice, hold, or risk it all!
- **Pure JavaScript**: No external libraries or frameworks needed.
- **Great for Friends**: Enjoy playing the Pig Game with friends at gatherings or during downtime.
